The data was collected through surveys by Kathmandu Living Labs and the Central Bureau of Statistics, which works under the National Planning Commission Secretariat of Nepal. This survey is one of the largest post-disaster datasets ever collected, containing valuable information on earthquake impacts, household conditions, and socio-economic-demographic statistics.

The goal is in this project estimate level of damage to buildings caused by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal in terms of the location and construction of the building.

The dataset mainly consists of information on the buildings' structure and their legal ownership. Each row in the dataset represents a specific building in the region that was hit by Gorkha earthquake.There are 39 columns in this dataset. The features in this dataset are as follows:


geo_level: geographic region in which building

count_floors_pre_eq: number of floors in the building before the earthquake

age : age of the building in years

area_percentage: normalized area of the building footprint

height_percentage : normalized height of the building footprint

land_surface_condition : surface condition of the land where the building was built. Possible values:

foundation_type : type of foundation used while building.

roof_type : type of roof used while building

ground_floor_type : type of the ground floor

other_floor_type : type of constructions used in higher than the ground floors .

position : position of the building. Possible values

plan_configuration: building plan configuration. Possible values:

has_superstructure_adobe_mud : flag variable that indicates if the superstructure was made of Adobe/Mud.

has_superstructure_mud_mortar_stone : flag variable that indicates if the superstructure was made of Mud Mortar - Stone

has_superstructure_stone_flag : flag variable that indicates if the superstructure was made of Stone

has_superstructure_cement_mortar_stone : flag variable that indicates if the superstructure was made of Cement Mortar - Stone

has_superstructure_mud_mortar_brick : flag variable that indicates if the superstructure was made of Mud Mortar - Brick.
