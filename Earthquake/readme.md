The data was collected through surveys by Kathmandu Living Labs and the Central Bureau of Statistics, which works under the National Planning Commission Secretariat of Nepal. This survey is one of the largest post-disaster datasets ever collected, containing valuable information on earthquake impacts, household conditions, and socio-economic-demographic statistics.

The goal is in this project estimate level of damage to buildings caused by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal in terms of the location and construction of the building.
