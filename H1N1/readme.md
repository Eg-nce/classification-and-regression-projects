What is H1N1?

H1N1 is a influenza virus causing illness in people. This virus was first detected in people in the United States in April 2009. This virus is spreading from person-to-person worldwide, probably in much the same way that regular seasonal influenza viruses spread.

As of the launch of this competition, vaccines for the COVID-19 virus are still under development and not yet available. The competition will instead revisit the public health response to a different recent major respiratory disease pandemic. Beginning in spring 2009, a pandemic caused by the H1N1 influenza virus, colloquially named "swine flu," swept across the world. Researchers estimate that in the first year, it was responsible for between 151,000 to 575,000 deaths globally.
